# PS2SC
Bounded model checker for PS 2.0

#### Prerequisites and Workflow

* Python2 - for compilation of the concurrent program into a sequential one. This is based on the [CSeq-framework](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~gp1y10/cseq/)

* CBMC - the CBMC binary which can be accessed from [here](http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/) and should be on your PATH. CBMC is the backend for verifying the sequentialized program generated by PS2SC.

#### Basic Usage

The `cseq-feeder.py` is the driver script. Invoke this as follows

```bash
cseq-feeder.py 
```
